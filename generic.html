								<p>As a sophomore in Duke University's Trinity College of Arts and Sciences, I am excited to take the next step in my professional development and am eager to find an internship where I can apply my skills and knowledge in computer science and linguistics, as well as my passion for ancient history and archaeology. <p> Throughout my academic career, I have consistently performed at a high level, earning a GPA of 4.00 and being named to the Dean's List with Distinction. I have a strong educational background in these fields, with a focus on data structures and algorithms and digital archaeology. In addition to my studies at Duke, I have also completed coursework in calculus, mechanics, and electricity and magnetism at Southern Methodist University. Along with my academic pursuits, I am also certified as an EMT-B and have gained valuable experience working during the COVID-19 pandemic.
									<p>Outside of my formal education, I have been actively involved in a variety of extracurricular activities. I have held leadership positions in organizations such as TEDxPEA, where I served as a speaker, and the Duke Pitchforks, where I served as an executive board member and business manager. I have also gained experience in curriculum development and instruction through my work with the start-up organization Pensos, which focuses on interactive methods of education for students in grades 6-12. In addition, I have served as a consultant and teaching assistant for Kyros, helping to design and revise sprint programs for high school students.</p><p>I have also had the opportunity to participate in classical archaeology excavation projects in Italy, where I applied novel digital archaeology techniques and studied stratigraphical matrices and inorganic material classification. I have also contributed to research on ancient urbanization and the collection and organization of images of sites in Sicily from the Middle Ages. In my free time, I have completed personal projects involving the development of a bread recipe program and statistical analysis of restaurant health ratings in NYC, demonstrating my dedication to continually learning and improving my skills.
									<p>I am confident that my strong educational background, diverse range of experiences, and proven ability to work independently and in team settings make me a well-qualified candidate for an internship. I am excited for the opportunity to continue to grow and learn, and believe that I have the drive and passion to make a positive impact as an intern. I am eager to find a company or organization where I can contribute my skills and knowledge and be a valuable member of the team.</p></p>
