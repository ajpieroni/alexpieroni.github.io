								<p>I am a junior at Duke University's Trinity College of Arts and Sciences, pursuing majors in Computer Science + Linguistics and Classical Languages, with a minor in Classical Archaeology. With a strong passion for ancient history and archaeology, I have actively engaged in various research and fieldwork projects. </p>
								<p>As an undergraduate research assistant and field archaeologist for the Vulci 3000 project, I have implemented novel digital archaeology techniques to study a Roman-Etruscan urban center, examining ancient urbanization. I have also contributed to the Neurocities and Ruinscapes project, reconstructing ancient cities in VR. Additionally, I have utilized 3D modeling, inscription translation, and VR to create an engaging experience of the Vicchio Stele, enhancing our understanding of its context. </p>
								<p>In my role as a consultant and teaching assistant for Kyros.ai, I have designed comprehensive sprint programs for high school students, helping them achieve their academic goals. I have also developed project-based curricula and provided private consulting, resulting in significant improvements in students' grades.</p>
								<p>As an executive board member and business manager for The Pitchforks of Duke University, I have managed numerous performance opportunities worldwide and implemented successful fundraising strategies, increasing group revenue by 20%. My experience in project management and financial planning has been instrumental in achieving organizational goals.</p>
								<p>Furthermore, I have gained valuable software engineering experience as a software engineer intern in Duke University's Code+ Program. Collaborating with the Office of Information Technology, I have developed a student portal integrated with a Package Training system to eliminate student wait times for package pickup. This project involved using technologies such as ReactJS, Docker, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.</p>
								<p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I have pursued personal projects that showcase my dedication to continuous learning and skill improvement. For instance, I have developed an interactive chatbot called ChatMedea, integrating a parsed dataset of Euripides' Medea with the Diablo GPT model. I have also developed a Java program called Route, which calculates the shortest path between two cities in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.</p>
								<p>With my strong educational background, diverse range of experiences in research, teaching, and software engineering, I am well-prepared to make a valuable impact as an intern. I am eager to contribute my skills, knowledge, and passion to a company or organization where I can continue to learn and grow while making a positive difference.</p>
